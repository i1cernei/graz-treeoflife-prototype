# Tree of life explorer prototype

This project connects to the gbif data and retrieves the taxa structure. As the user hovers over taxa it will look up entries
on wikipedia to find the definition of the taxa and return the first part of the article. It will also run a wikimedia search and attempt to retrieve
an appropriate image.

## TODO
- navigate backwards in the taxa (run reverse query)
- create fallback image search (perhaps from gbif data)
- create fallback definitions search from other encyclopedic source, perhaps one on biology
- implement circle visualization in threejs or p5 for the taxa structure instead of video background file
- create physical interaction in nodejs
- adapt design
- containerize and prepare for deployment

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

It will also start the nodejs server for the api.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
